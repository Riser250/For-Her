    <p>Over the 69 days, i have enjoyed every moment we‚Äôve spent talking, hanging out and even arguing after looking back (cuz without the few arguments we might not be how we are) . and like i just wanna thank you for being around and becoming a person im close to (even though you don‚Äôt like the thought of being close to people lol) and no matter what we are or ever will be, i will still forever and ever thank and appreciate you. Even though i may annoy you (and you don‚Äôt admit it but i think i do sometimes) or like be dryy i want you to know i never purposefully do anything to try and ‚Äúpush you away‚Äù or jeopardise anything we have. Like everyday i get excited or happy just to talk to you, and i look forward for days we get to hang out, no matter what we do aslong as i get to be with you i enjoy it! Even just talking to you like we did before we both fell asleep lmfao makes me happy. Sometimes i don‚Äôt think you realise how much i actually enjoy to be in your presence and company, and as i said i think i see you differently to how you see yourself as i see you as a supportive, caring, kind and all round great person no matter how sometimes you may try hide it. ü§ç

Yours sincerely - Your Sonetti Boy</p>
    <p>But whatever and whatever happens, i want you to know that don‚Äôt ever settle for less than what i‚Äôve shown or even double (lol) of what i‚Äôve shown. You as a person may deny your true self but i have seen and experienced how much of an amazing genuine supportive caring (somewhat lol) affectionate person always willing to put everything especially for me in-front of what you want and i hope you know as much as i show and try tell you how i feel for you, everything i ever do or say i mean it with my whole heart and as a person i am so so lucky to have gotten to know you and to be close with you. Everyday i think i‚Äôm lucky and am curious what i did to ever deserve you and to get the daily pleasure of me getting and choosing to be nice and kind and to care for you every single day no matter what. I truly believe you are a great person who i adore and it doesn‚Äôt ever matter what happens between us, i will always and i mean always be there for you! Some of this sounds like i see us stop talking in the future, but if i‚Äôm being honest i want and see the complete opposite, i want us to continue talking and for me to continue getting to be close to you every single day.

Forever and Ever</p>
    <p>probably cuz i‚Äôm not fully here but i just want to say some stuff that‚Äôs been on my mind, i told you that you have my whole heart. and i mean that. i want you with my whole heart, i want to treat you how you‚Äôve never been treated. 

In one of the questions yesterday or whenever it was ‚ÄúWhen did you almost say ‚Äúi love you‚Äù but stopped?‚Äù i wanted to answer but i couldn‚Äôt truthfully but my answer would be that more and more recently i have wanted to say it, this doesn‚Äôt mean i will because i guess im waiting, this just explains how ive felt and how much my feelings for you have grown and become more vivid to me. i forever want you to know i will be here to adore you, to adore the steps you take, to adore the words you say, to adore everything you do.

i want you to know i truly miss you day in a day out, to me there not just words i say often, their words that deeply mean something, i have never once missed someone as dearly as i miss you. you don‚Äôt ever evade my thoughts, the key part of my thoughts every day involves you, i don‚Äôt wake up without thinking about you, i don‚Äôt go through my day without thinking about you, i don‚Äôt fall asleep without thinking about you. the words actually mean how i feel about you and how i want you to know that i can never stop thinking about the woman i adore.

I think most days about how i dont ever want to mess things up with you because you are unknowingly what ive been looking for, when we first met, i wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsearching‚Äù for anything never mind a girl who makes me ‚Äúyearn‚Äù for her day in and day out and makes me want to spend every second awake with her. my biggest fear with you is losing you or making you ever even have feeling of dislike or any negative feeling towards or about me.

i think with you i get excited on what the future may hold, some days i may or may not have feelings of impatience but i will forever be patient with you and respect everything and anything to do with you. 

AND i feel like today with the ‚Äúdumb thing‚Äù you over thought which is no where near dumb, annoyed me because i just never want you to 1 think that anything you think about is dumb and 2 to ever feel like  i wont sit and listen or respond however you want me to to what you may feel. i just didn‚Äôt like the fact that it was something to do with me you were overthinking because i want you to always feel like there‚Äôs nothing to overthink because i make how i feel and everything i think about you pretty clear, but of course there will always be times we both overthink which i understand and why i don‚Äôt like to push to get ‚Äúit out of you‚Äù .</p>
    <p>i enjoyed talking to you today so let me do this again.

As the more time passes i still can‚Äôt believe that i met you over A TDM like how has this happened, i sat doing tdm day in day out never meaning to find someone i would do anything for. I want you to know how much i really do appreciate you and value you. You are such an amazing person who honestly deserves the world and all the kindness in it.

We spent a lot of time last night talking and i really thought it was productive and i want you to know that every word i spoke was true. I want you. Everything about you i want. In my eyes your mine but by label not yet and as i said i would wait forever for you to be ready as-long as you reassure me I‚Äôm still what and who you want. I also want you to understand i do actually want you like for realsies with my whole heart. You mean the world to me and i want you to be all mine. I have thought about the distance with you and i can confidently say for me that is not a worry and for you i could be on a different planet and i would still want and adore you.

I never thought that one woman could make such an impact on me to the point where all i do is think about her like for instance when i hear the song Sweater Weather i think about the time she told me she did a performance of it in high school but wouldn‚Äôt look for the video to show me. Or whenever i see sea life it makes me think of her and the first time she told me about the shark facts and i was lucky enough to sit there and listen. Even just to star signs if they are mentioned it takes me back to the time we spent hours sat talking about them ON THE FIRST DAY WE MET. And i knew ever since the day i could listen to a girl and just be happy there i knew she was the one i wanted.

I think about you and can just sit there and smile, there is no other woman that i can imagine ever competing with you. The way i adore and obsess over you is unmatched and something i have never experienced before. Just hearing about your past experiences and the ways you‚Äôve been treated, that alone makes me want to treat you better. I don‚Äôt know why you can never escape my mind, i can‚Äôt sleep most nights because i‚Äôm thinking of you and obsessing over you because of how much i adore you.

There‚Äôs sometimes we can be talking and all i want to say is that i love you, and it‚Äôs hard to not say it, i will probably end up slipping up and saying it earllyyyy soon because of how much i just want to just yell it at you and tell you all about it. I think i adopted the word ‚Äúadore‚Äù as a replacement of it and so i can wait to say it. But i really really hope the day you‚Äôre ready you literally just yell it at me no matter what‚Äôs going on.

Sometimes, thinking about me going of as a water boy worries me too as i never want to stop talking to you, and as i have said i will continue to forever try with you until you are done, no matter what situation i‚Äôm ever in in life with the water boy i will always try with you. 

i still can‚Äôt get over how obsessed i am with you, and i feel so lucky to be able to be obsessed over you, all my feelings towards you are a gift i will never be deserving of and i have no idea how to explain what i ever did to be lucky enough for you to express similar feelings. Each and every day and night i smile at my phone talking to you, i laugh with you, im happy with you. Every night i look forward for the next day to be able and talk and hang out with you, and i loveeeeee the fact that i get to hang out with you.

On my break of writing this i saw a questions tiktok so why not answer them for you:

When was the last time you thought ‚Äúi‚Äôm lucky to have her‚Äù?

Every breathing moment i feel lucky to be able to have you.


What‚Äôs something about me you can‚Äôt explain but love anyway?

Difficult questions i feel like i can explain a lot of how i feel but one thing i love about you is when you get giddy and smiley, it‚Äôs makes me so happy to make you happy.

I‚Äôve used to many characters!!</p>
    <p>well baby‚Ä¶.

101 days later (i spent so long writing it‚Äôs 102 days). Ever since the first day we met and spent all that time together lol and all them tdms. This whole time we‚Äôve had our ups and our downs and we can both more than admit that. But i wouldn‚Äôt change how we are for a thing, the thought of us distancing fears me, like i get stressed thinking about it and don‚Äôt ever want that.

i get recently we‚Äôve been going through some times of tension that has been tough and hard because all i ever want to do maiya is be with you and love you. your all i ever think about, the only person i ever want to talk to.

each time we get tensions, the fear of not talking to you always sets in and i mean every time. every time we may argue and i ask if you still want me or something like that is because i think about us not talking and it scares me and upsets me so that‚Äôs why i ask for the reassurance.

i feel emotions and i feel emotions hard, sometimes one could say im too sensitive, maybe i am and maybe i try masking it behind everything i can because i dont always know how to express it. but when it comes to you my emotions are always strong because of how deeply i love you maiya.

this message was gonna go into a few of our downs like howwww the first one when you told me about mr man and honestly i was relieved when you told me that, i also expected then that you didn‚Äôt want to talk to me. even during then i didn‚Äôt want to lose you because i see how special you are and how special you have become to me.

and then the second time in the tdm when you tdmq and my embarrassing fact is that i didn‚Äôt notice you did and u ran around for a good ass minute looking for you lmaooo. that one upset me quite a bit and i didn‚Äôt like the fact i had upset you by calling you something you completely are not.

overall maiya i love you and will continue to love you a lot for realsies. i miss you the times we‚Äôre apart, the times i don‚Äôt get to be with you. and i hope to continue admiring you day in and day out.</p>
    <p>but nevertheless, i‚Äôve lived with my ‚Äúmom‚Äù my entire life speaking to her everyday, i‚Äôm leaving her and that‚Äôs gonna kill as much as she annoys me.

i speak to my dad often and like as much as he can also annoy me he‚Äôs my biggest supporter and im leaving him.

YOU the woman i love and have spoke to more than anyone recently im leaving and honestly your the hardest person to leave because the thought of not having you kills me like all this hurts me so so much and i don‚Äôt know how to express it all. like ive barley ever left home to go away alone and it‚Äôs scary not knowing anyone, going to a new place 128 miles from me. like i have no idea what to expect and im like excited for it but also im terrified because of the change.

i wish you could be here and i put you in a bag and take me lmao. but no matter what happens i will love you and always want you.

i yapped and lowkey some tears left my eyes LMAOO</p>
    <p>urm. I get your ignoring me or whatever I'm not too sure but it's okay.

You told me not to apologise for being grumpy ever, yet I'm going to continue apologising because any grumpiness or attitude should never be directed towards you as I've said before, I never intend to be mean or ever intend to be rude to you as that isn't what you deserve. from me you deserve the best, you deserve to be loved, cared for, obsessed over and everything else. recently I may have been lacking in that department compared to how I used to be but I can promise you that doesn't mean my feelings for you have changed at all and I want to try get better again at showing you my affection more vividly. I still love you like I always have but I may just not be showing it as well. someday I may take the affection you show me for granted and I don't always realise that and regret every time I sit there and think, "oh shit she doesn't actually have to show me affection" and that its a blessing I get to receive from you. I appreciate you each and everyday even when its not expressed or even when I admit I take you for granted. I still love you a lot, I still look forward to talking to you. I sit in the vc even when you're not there just in hopes you may join and I get to talk to you and hear your voice. even just the sound of your voice puts a smile on my face. you make me a happier person and I don't show that appreciation towards you enough. I understand there is a lot going on for you and a lot of things causing you stress right now and I hate to be apart of the reasons that cause you stress. I try help you as best I can like with the uptown situation and anything else causing you the stress, I also try just be there for you. going back to me hating being apart of your stress, I really don't like it as I always want to be a place where you can feel at peace and a break from everything else going on, sometimes I don't try hard enough to be your "safe space" to relieve from stress but I promise you I always want to be a place of peace for you. iiiiiiiiiiiii justttttttttttt loveeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuuu alottttttttt

Yours sincerely - Your Sonetti Boy</p>
    <p>MAIYA

I love you

i apologise for getting annoyed or like grumpy or like attitude but like the only reason i did is that we were planning to like play gamess and weed and i know we always do stuff which i love doing but i get that you want to be in city with people you dont see to often because we spend alot of time together. BUT i just always want to be with you and maybe im being too clingy but knowing your like with people like walker who is the newest competitor i guess lol i just get jealous and as we know when i get jealous i get grumpy so i apologise for that and its not your fault.</p>
    <p>Maiya,

I feel it‚Äôs been awhile since i‚Äôve done a big paragraph that i‚Äôve got to finish so some emotions with you may be unexpressed. I want to start by saying maiya i love you with my entire heart and as i have repeatedly said as long as you still love me i‚Äôll still be here, my love for you will not ever disintegrate at all each and every day my love grows for you. And i truly mean that, every single day that passes ever since the first day or up until the 127th day my love has always grown for you. I know we have our ups and downs with small disagreements but as i said we will never go to sleep not talking and as you said i wont let you. No matter the disagreement maiya we get through it, no matter the over thinking we get through it, no matter the emotions we get through it. Each and every time baby we can always get through it and continue to be grateful for every single day we spend together. Spending my days with you truly makes me happy, when we call you sometimes ask why i just smile, and without a doubt the reason i smile is due to hearing your voice orrr seeing your face because no matter what you can make me happy, one of the questions i just added is ‚Äú- What‚Äôs a trait of mine that instantly calms you?‚Äù and my answer to that is literally hearing your voice, no matter how mad or upset or annoyed i may get hearing your voice always makes me happy. You are my best friend, the person i‚Äôm closest with, the person i love, the person i can tell my whole heart and head to even if you think i don‚Äôt tell you much but i can promise you maiya i tell you everything. As i‚Äôve stated in other paragraphs i loved you since the very beginning since the many hours we spent talking, i once said ‚Äúdo you think we can beat that time we spent together‚Äù and through our many 24 hour calls i think we‚Äôve beaten it lol. As much as you may not believe i love you maiya i can promise you with my entire heart i truly adore you, and every single day i appreciate you for choosing me over your other options and each and everyday i try work on myself to be the best person i can for you, you ask why i was so nice to you, it was because i believe that‚Äôs what you deserve from me, i tell you to never settle but if im not giving you that then you‚Äôre settling so i‚Äôll continue to be as nice as loving as caring as i can be towards you to show you what you deserve in life my love. Some days i just sit and think about how much i love you and i can‚Äôt express the true depths of it so just start to get giddy with myself and start to compliment you to attempt to show the depths i love you but it will truly be impossible to show you my complete love for you.

I understand as much as you don‚Äôt admit it sometimes you distance yourself in tension my love which i would admit i don‚Äôt like but also i‚Äôm learning to not accept it but become more i guess ‚Äúused to it‚Äù, and i continue to try and ‚Äúpull you back‚Äù and give you the reassurance on how much i adore and obsess over you my love. And the distancing is understandable and everything you feel is understandable but you need to know how much i truly love you and forever will and will forever be grateful for you.

Maiya i wait for you each and everyday like in the vcs or whatever and that‚Äôs not so i can throw it back in your face and be like ‚Äúi waited all day for you‚Äù the reason i do it is because im waiting for you to join even if you get 10 mins i‚Äôll be there just to talk to you for any time possible. Any time with you means the world. I love to hear your voice, to see your face. And being in the vcs gives me more of a random chance for you to join at any point.

Another thing i want to talk about which i know frustrates you when i get petty when i get jealous, the only reason i get jealous maiya is because i see how great you are and i know others see that too, i dont like the fact others try and they get time with you i could be getting lol sorry if thats abit crazy but it the truth my love, and i know im all yours and</p>
    <p>This is a new message my love
To Maiya, my love,

ah i think their might have been more but it‚Äôs okay. Maiya, all these words all these emotions, all these watery eyes haven‚Äôt just been fake, they have been for you, they have been because i truly love you, because i truly want you. I have always felt so strongly towards you maiya like all these words show my feelings towards you, i‚Äôll continue to tell you how much i love you maiya like i love you, i hate that you think what you think about how i feel but it means i get to express each and EVERY day how i truly feel about you and how i adore you as much as we still met. I tell you these things not just so you can be ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù but so you can stay with me and i can continue to love you and vice verse, i know you love me maiya and i know you don‚Äôt want this to end just like i don‚Äôt want it too. I adore you maiya and i think you just overthink how i feel baby because i have never once lied about my feelings towards you or any of my emotions because i truly feel these things in my heart. each and every day i believe you feel the same about me as i feel about you and i know you do because you show it just as i do. i love you maiya which means im going to continue trying for you. i will forever try for you maiya i love you so so much. you are my baby girl, lowkey i was talking to my mum about you because she knows it‚Äôs you because she‚Äôs seen my phone in mornings apart from she thinks your name is ‚Äúmai‚Äù and i was lowkey telling her i loved you as i truly do, that may have just been drunk me telling her too many things tbh but she won‚Äôt remember either smh. like you make me actually happier and i know i can make you happy too my love and i know you enjoy being with me you just fear the future but i will forever reassure you my love. Each and every message here have either been at times where they are needed or times where i can‚Äôt contain how much i love you, but no matter the reason, all the words said have been true and they will continue to be true. im just thinking back to the times i was so nervous to say i love you or the times i was nervous to talk to you and hear your voice like i genuinely got heavily nervous because i loved you so much even at the beginning before i knew much about you, like the feeling in my stomach when we first said we loved each other was crazy but yet 132 days and now it rolls of my tongue how much i love you, even now though i still get butterflies when expressing my emotions to you. You once told me that i could never be to clingy but sometimes i wonder if i am likeeee with the vcs and staying in them or like the matching profiles, all these things i love just because it makes me feel closer to you and more connected to you my love, like even with these apps i got you to download they just make me feel closer which is why i asked you to get them. I just love being with you and feeling connected with you, like i really want to watch these shows with you, sorry this is off topic i‚Äôll try go back on topic, wait not yet, like i really wanna watch love island with you tomorrow because i want to watch leah‚Äôs crashouts to rob sorry of topic lemme go back. I am just obsessed with you maiya and i never want to be too much for you but i am always going to be here reassuring you because you are who i want and i only want to love you and keep you as my baby girl. i am all yours baby and want to remain all yours, i find it so hard just to express how i truly feel about you like my love for you is crazy i am really obsessed with you always on my mind and always wanting you. BABY i hate when you over think my love i understand it‚Äôs part of your brain and you over thinking my love but i just don‚Äôt like how you think i don‚Äôt love you when all i do is give you all my love like sometimes i raise my tone towards you when trying to express my love because of how deeply i feel towards you,</p>
    <p>Maiya,

I hope you know i don‚Äôt tell you lies. Stereotypically navy men cheat but my only knowledge of it is from men who were in, in the 90s and were shit husbands anyways. I tell you i‚Äôm loyal to you no matter what we are from ever since we started talking and that‚Äôs the truth my love, i only want you and i‚Äôm staying loyal to you and staying yours. I understand the past 3 or 4 or whatever days have been rough my love but as i always say, no matter what we go through no matter what happens, i will always be here the next day and the next. I love you Maiya, and i‚Äôll continue to be here trying with you and i‚Äôll continue to be yours and only yours. And again i get these days have been tough and it‚Äôs been hard for you (and me) thinking about water boy ect and i won‚Äôt say it will be easy, but as you said, these 4 days may be good for us and give us the true ability to miss each other and allow our hearts to grow fonder of each other. Maiya i see how much you love me and how genuine and loving and kind you are, never in any life time i would just ‚Äúthrow you away‚Äù i see you and the true you and i adore you and am completely obsessed with you my love. 

My love im here, im here for you, im here to be with you, i would never in a million years even think about cheating, no matter what im yours and hate the thought of even cheating, that is the honestly think i despise most in this world for me.

My pretty girl, i feel as much as these days have been hard i believe that they have brought us closer together and bonded us more, im not sure how you feel, but i feel ive had the ability to be truly ‚Äúmyself‚Äù and honest with you and i guess have opened up to you more because of how completely comfortable i feel with you, your so easy for me to talk to and open up myself to like when i didn‚Äôt cry lol, your a person i know a lot of people find easy to talk to but you genuinely to me are my closest person who i can genuinely talk to about anything at anytime and im so so happy you‚Äôre my girl.


Forever and ever
Your Handsome Boyü§ç</p>
    <p>Well my love, this may be a long one i have a lot of time i‚Äôm not to sure.

Wow, 141 days, not one moment when we first met did i ever believe we would be talking after the first week, of course i had hopes because as soon as we started talking i could tell how intelligent, fun and funny person you are who has truly made me happy along our whole relationship. Not one moment with you have i ever had to fake a smile, fake a laugh. (my fingers are shaking writing this) With you i have never had to fake anything i have always been able to be my true self and been able to love you unconditionally through our whole time, i know i started of with all the little things i did and i know those things seemed to stop and you may have thought i was slacking or not trying as hard with you but no matter what i did or what i said i can promise you there hasn‚Äôt been a moment through all these days that you have not passed my mind because since day one i have been obsessed. When i initially added your discord, i saw your profile picture and was speaking to my friend with a crazy girl i was like she‚Äôs funny she‚Äôs kind and all of this and i saw her picture and she is stunning lol, ever since then your beauty with your looks and personality has grown in my eyes and each and every day my love for you grows. I have hopes for the future as one day i truly want to meet you. I sit at night on times you fall asleep before me sitting looking at my roof in the dark thinking about how much i love you and how much you truly mean to me maiya.

I understand these 4 days have been eating on your mind (mine too) and it‚Äôs not been easy for you thinking about us not talking for a few days, and i know you want us to end things so that in the end you don‚Äôt have to experience us not talking and can end it on your terms. But i can promise you that these past few days have killed me, my anxiety for this trips has grown, not because i‚Äôm scared or fearful of the trip or anything but because i‚Äôm scared of not talking to you, scared of losing you and not being around to ‚Äútalk you out of it‚Äù or even to just talk to you in general, you were asking me yesterday what was wrong and it was that i was anxious, truthfully to you this is the first time i think i‚Äôve truly felt anxious and it is because i‚Äôm leaving you and the fear of you not being here when im back. Like if i knew you were 110% going to be here when im back so i can tell you all about it and you can tell me all about your week i would be excited too. (and i still want you to write your days down to tell me about them) I love you maiya and the thought of losing you is genuinely killing me. The thought of me being the cause of you being upset the majority of the time and the thought i may affect you negatively kills me. Maiya i don‚Äôt want you to feel stuck here and if you feel no hope i don‚Äôt want you to stay somewhere you feel pointless, like you telling me this stuff killed me reading and i‚Äôm not gonna lie again as i‚Äôve been emotionally weak this past week i coulda cried again on the train lmfao, I hate hate hate the though that i‚Äôm negative towards you and you don‚Äôt feel any i guess desire to love me like you used to hurts like when you‚Äôre dry truthfully kills me, i hate it but i know it‚Äôs just you protecting yourself so i just continue to try and be normal and love you because maiya i truly do love you, i have loved learning about you, loved getting to be with you everyday, loved learning all your little traits, loved learning your history and where you come from ect, loved learning about your life experiences. Every single one of our conversations i have loved because each and everyone has led to us becoming closer and closer. 

Well maiya i know we‚Äôve gone through some rough arguments and tough conversations and i can admit too that they weren‚Äôt easy like each and everyone takes a little bit out of me, and i know the more we have the more it pushes you away and that thought hurts, i hate the thought of you being pushed away little by little until the day you sadly leave. I once said to you on the first of june at 1:54 that ‚ÄúIn the end it will be your decision‚Äù and you asked why and to that i said ‚ÄúJust a feeling, Because i know it won‚Äôt be me‚Äù and sadly i was right, the thought of you leavening me has always been in the back of my mind, from leaving me in city cuz rick was ugly lol to you leaving me because you lost love and feelings for me, these fears have always been at the back of my mind scaring me each and everyday. and every time you want to leave i fight so hard for you to stay because i want to continue loving you but i truly don‚Äôt want you to stay somewhere you don‚Äôt feel like you love or is beneficial for you anymore my dear as much as it kills me to say. I know throughout these whole situations it may seem i have been (i‚Äôm tearing up) selfish but i can promise you each and every time it all comes from a place of love and wanting to continue to love you my dear. 

I‚Äôm scared maiya, i‚Äôm scared to lose you, i‚Äôm scared to never see you, to never speak to you again. I am man enough to admit im scared. I really don‚Äôt want to lose you maiya i want to continue loving you but i know if you don‚Äôt want to be loving me that i can‚Äôt force you to stay as much as it kills me, as much as i wish i could just keep you in my pocket forever with me it kills me of the thought of letting you go. oh god like i don‚Äôt know what id do without you my dear you have become a huge part of my life, the person i talk to the most, i truly do not talk to my friends and have never spoke to them to amount i speak to you. I speak to you much more than anyone else and you have become my person, the person i can go to for anything, the person i felt loved by unconditionally, the person who has truly made have no insecurities of my looks as much as i did before i met you, you have made me feel way better and confident about myself than anybody else has which is crazy my love because i‚Äôve never liked the way i looked until i met you and you called me handsome every day no matter what i looked like no matter my haircut what i was wearing or whatever you still called me handsome and have made me feel better about my self, now i just wish you could see yourself how i see you my love.

This is a big paragraph way over 4000 characters and i can go on forever and may still go on later but now i‚Äôm going to send you it and even though you said you‚Äôre gone to work i hope you take the time to read it. i started writing this 40 minutes ago just in case you thought i was ignoring you, i wasn‚Äôt i was just writing this my dear.

Forever and ever!
Your sonetti boyü§ç</p>
    <p>Hey baby,
AHH i need to write a paragraph or i might explode, i don‚Äôt know why but i just wanted to to keep telling you how much i love you and all of that but like i‚Äôm just full of love for you my dear so i need to express it to you. MAIYA each and every day you continue to make me happy and make me feel loved, and i know sometimes i may annoy you or stress you out and i apologise, it‚Äôs just because i want you and want to talk to you and want to love you. Like when i say i love you it isn‚Äôt just words that i say out of consistency, it‚Äôs words i truly and deeply mean and i wish you could understand how much i love you and how i want to spend every second with you. I apologise for falling asleep, last night i was literally sat up trying not to sleep but i think it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm doing gym and swimming more now so i just get tired easier. BUT ANYWAYS, back to how much i love you. There isn‚Äôt a second that goes by that you aren‚Äôt on my mind and missing you and wanting your presence with me. And i don‚Äôt know where this paragraphs going baby but i just needed to write something to express my love for you, and no i truly haven‚Äôt do anything wrong or done anything i just really want you to know and try understand how deep my love is for you. So like, a lot of this sonetti stuff is on my mind and like i want to leave, i‚Äôve decided. And i would preferably want you to become a civ with me but if that ideal solution won‚Äôt happen, i would join uptown to be with you and whatever problems that causes with anyone else then we can just solve them as they come baby, but i do want to be able to do everything with you and im at the point right now where i would leave to join baby and i do want to be with you. anyways that was a side note baby but basically
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU 
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU
I LOVE YOU

And another side note, i hope you know how happy i was when i saw you in the vc when i woke up and i did join the vc and still am there but just in case you wake up after i leave. it was cute i loved it i love you. 
</p>
   <p>Yeah i know we‚Äôve had our moments, and we‚Äôll continue to have them. The fights, the silences, the words we wish we could take back and we can‚Äôt. But the truth is i‚Äôll continue to always choose you, we‚Äôve built so much together in such a short amount of time why would we just up and walk away from it all? Every memory we‚Äôve made is stitched into me, our belly laughs, the inside jokes, the way my eyes always reach yours every time, the nights we stayed up dreaming and fantasising about our forever and our future families and our future kids. Even when we‚Äôre hurting, even when it feels like the weight of the world is pressing down on us because there will be those times, even though at times there‚Äôs distance between us, i‚Äôd rather carry that weight with you than live without you, loving you won‚Äôt always be easy and loving me won‚Äôt always be easy and i know that. But it‚Äôs always been worth it. And it‚Äôll continue to be worth it. And if choosing you means fighting through the storms, then i‚Äôll keep choosing you every single time, because losing you isn‚Äôt an option, not when i can see you in my forever.

I transcribed this because i heard it and felt so deeply to it and felt related to it with you my love‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <p>The distance between us means so little because you mean so much to me, although being away from you feels like carrying around a piece of me that‚Äôs missing, i remind myself that missing you is just proof of how much i love you, i hate the quite nights without your voice, the mornings without your smiles, the moments where i wish i could just reach for your hands and feel it warm in mine. Sometimes life feels paused without you here, like im living in black and white, while waiting for all the colours to come rushing back the moment i see you. And even with all the distance between you and i, i wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything else, because the truth is, distance means nothing compared to what you mean to me, you‚Äôre worth every tear i have to wipe away, when we have to say goodbye, every mile that separates us,every second of missing you and even when it hurts, the hurt is still wrapped in love. One day the waiting will be over and until the i‚Äôll keep loving you from many many miles away. I‚Äôll keep holding onto the thoughts of you running into your arms, hearing your laughter echoing in the same room as mine, of waking up to your face instead of a phone screen. The day we close this distance will be the day i finally feel whole again. But until then i carry this love across every mile because no distance is in this world could ever make me stop choosing you. 

sorry i also saw this one and liked it ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <p>The Starter

So of course my love I will say we stay together. You want reasons so i will give you plenty.

The Introduction

Maiya my love I know there are a hand full of things that can list of about me that frustrate you, why wouldn't there be, we spend so much time together we get to see all of each others flaws (you don't have any) but at the same time we get to see each others strengths and beauty's.
MY FLAWS
1a. The Comments

The comments I make the snarky once's or whatever they may be I can only apologise for after, the time of saying them I don't believe I think about them nor do they have any malicious intent or any like actually negative emotion with them, but once you point them out I understand and think about what I said the comment I made and how you may perceive it and only then do I realise they are fucked up or can be taken with attitude. 

1b. The Solution To The Comments

Now I am consciously making an effort to think about how the words I say and the things I do can be taken and how they can be seen and how they truly make you feel. For you my love I'm willing to make myself better and the comments are just shitty and I'm sorry for that.

2a. Being Literal

Urm yeah I'm sorry about that it isn't good sometimes I know, I truly don't know like sometimes I see spelling mistakes and just wonder if its like what the word urm, slag? or wtv idk but its just me trying not to be dumb and like just making sure i know what you mean so I don't misinterpret it. So overall I'm sorry you have to explain yourself a lot.

2b. The Solution To Being Literal

I plan on using more common sense lol and just understanding what you say more and not needing to ask you as many questions, there's not much other solution than using common sense.

I Have No More Of The Top Of My Head So Let Me Know And Ill Add More


The Main Paragraph

Baby OR Billy as you didn't want me to call you. I want to start of by saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry for all stated above, I'm sorry for any wrong i do towards you my love. You Maiya mean the world to me, you are the person who makes me happy, makes me smile. I get told on the daily by different people that I sound happier and better and they all say its you, each and everyone says you are the right person for me and the person who made me happy again. I think i told you, but if i never met you i would have left sonettis long before now. As much as you think you're the sole reason I left, you kept me in sonettis. I went through some hard times there and it wasn't easy but I had you, You made my city life more fun made it all more fun and kept me there, until the day I realised rick is gonna die at some point why doesn't he finally have fun with you before he does. So to summarise these past few paragraphs, YOU maiya YOU make me happy, you make rick happy, you make Luca happy. And I like to hope I do the same for you and I get to be the person that makes you happy but I know sometimes I can do the opposite. I wake up on a day to day every single day missing you, all day everyday you are my thoughts. I forever want to be with you and hate the times apart because no matter what I love you presence and love having you around me. Baby I know we go through what we do baby but I promise I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I will love you forever and ever, you are my dear my billy. I don't EVER EVER want to lose you, I've hated today, I've loved still being in your presence but as always I hate the tension between us always.

Final Plead

Baby pleaseee don't leaveeeeee.

If The Plead Didn't Work Then The Threat

If you love me you'll stay with me.

The End

Baby I love you and I'm sorry for all the tension I just wanna stay loving you and showing you all of my AFFACTION.</p>
    <p>Baby,

It‚Äôs been 173 days that‚Äôs 5.688 months.

How i fell for you‚Ä¶ The day we met in the lounge (which i wish i had the clip it‚Äôs crazy neither of us were) and i was the loudest and you were the prettiest in the room, for some reason you spoke to me even though i didn‚Äôt have a chin and is disgusting and British and annoying but anyways. I saw tina and as you know my eyes went straight to her and wanting to get to know you and keep talking to and is why i called you back. That‚Äôs a tangent but anyways, i could tell from the beginning how much of a kind and genuine person you were just from the way you carried yourself, the way you were open to talk to me and didn‚Äôt just tell me to fuck off and instead said to call later (which i was clearly going to do) and then after the TDM you stayed with me to speak instead of going of with your gang. All of this initially showed to me how much of a kind person you are and then clearly we spent the time after which made me instantly click and get close to you and already from there i started to love you and immediately fell for you and your voice and how pretty you sounded and all the interesting things we were talking about.

I know you feel my love may have lessened for you my dear but i can promise you without a doubt, that no such thing has happened, my heart and body and bones are still all yours 110% and they are where i want them to be. I want to stay yours, like i forever want, i truly never want to lose you.

I stopped writing this that night but i starting again tonight on the 18th, when you say we're done.

Maiya, my love

Though you may not believe my heart belongs to you i can promise you with everything in me, my biggest dream in life is to have you in my arms and one day i will make it happen i can promise you that. I know youre over thinking alot and im sorry, i kknow its shit i promise i know. and i know i say things like im not good for you, but i try maiya, i try be the best i can for you, the best you deserve, i think i am good for you even with the overthinking, im here im gonna be here for you. wether you believe im good for you or not, i know youre good for me, you have been such a positive in my life and you made me happy again, made me laugh, made me smile, made me fall in love with you (even though you didnt have to try hard) every since day one you have been a positive for me and have all been there to support me through everything ive gone through maiya, youve been the person im able to cry too, tell my feelings and thoughts too all without any judgement. youve been my "rock" as some say. i cant lose you maiya, itll kill me to lose you and i dont ever want to go a day without being there with you, talking to you, being with you, loving you, laughing with you, doing stupid stuff with you and everything else we get up too in our many hours of talking. There hasnt been a day go by where i havent missed you, loved you, spoke to you, thought about you, fell asleep dreaming about you. 

I love you maiya,

Im sorry, 

I dont want to lose you...</p>
    <p>chatgpts summary of all of my paragraphs

You‚Äôve spent the past few months (over 130+ days) growing incredibly close to Maiya. From the very beginning, through talking, gaming, arguing, and hanging out, you‚Äôve built a deep bond that means the world to you. You constantly express how grateful you are for her presence in your life, how much you appreciate her kindness, care, and support (even when she denies being that way), and how lucky you feel to have met her.

You reassure her often that despite your disagreements or moments of tension, your love only grows stronger each day. You admit you can be sensitive, jealous, or grumpy at times, but you never mean to hurt her and always apologize when you do. You explain that your jealousy comes from loving her so much and fearing losing her.

Maiya is always on your mind‚Äîyou wake up, go through your day, and fall asleep thinking about her. You miss her deeply when apart and get excited to spend even the simplest moments with her. You admire her smile, her voice, her quirks, and the way she makes you happy without trying. She‚Äôs your best friend, safe space, and the person you want to build a future with.

You‚Äôve been nervous at times to say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, but your feelings have only gotten stronger, and now you say it freely because it‚Äôs the truth of how you feel. You want her to know you‚Äôll always be there for her, support her, and continue trying no matter what happens or how much distance is between you.

Overall, all your words boil down to this:
üëâ You are completely in love with Maiya.
üëâ You adore and cherish her every single day.
üëâ You are committed to being patient, reassuring, and loyal.
üëâ You want her to feel loved, safe, and valued with you forever.</p>
